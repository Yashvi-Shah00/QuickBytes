Icahn -- who owns 2% of the company -- nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro for the positions. Must Read: Warren Buffet's 10 Favorite Stocks STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more. This isn't the first rift between Icahn and eBay. The activisit investor has been a vocal proponent of eBay splitting from online pay service PayPal. eBay, meanwhile, has repeatedly rejected any consideration of such a split. Icahn accused chief executive Jon Donahoe of ""inexcusable incompetence"" Monday for failing to see the value of separating the upstart PayPal service from eBay. TheStreet Ratings team rates EBAY INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: We rate EBAY INC (EBAY) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share and good cash flow from operations. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat disappointing return on equity."]

The Trinamool Congress swept all four assembly seats in West Bengal with Udayan Guha winning the Dinhata seat, previously held by the BJP, by a margin of 1,63,005 votes. Meanwhile, the Congress party swept the Himachal and Rajasthan bypolls. The party wrested the Mandi Lok Sabha seat from the BJP and won all three assembly seats in Himachal Pradesh. In Rajasthan, the party won both the Dhariawad and Vallabhnagar assembly constituencies with margins of 18,725 and 20,606 votes, respectively. It also reclaimed Madhya Pradesh’s Raigaon, a traditional BJP seat, after 31 years, besides bagging one seat each in Karnataka and Maharashtra. However, it lost Jobat, a reserved ST seat, and the Prithvipur assembly seat in MP to the BJP, which also retained its Khandwa Lok Sabha seat. The BJP-led alliance claimed victory in all five assembly seats in Assam. The saffron party also wrested Telangana’s Huzurabad from the ruling TRS, while securing a win in Karnataka’s Sindagi. In Haryana’s Ellenabad, INLD’s Abhay Chautala bagged a win over BJP-JJP candidate in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers’ agitation. In Bihar, the ruling JD(U) retained both the Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats. The Shiv Sena party secured the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat, with MP Sanjay Raut calling it a “giant leap towards Delhi.” Meanwhile, the NPP-led Meghalaya Democratic Alliance clinched all three assembly seats, wresting Rajabala and Mawryngkneng seats from the Congress."]
# article=["In this study, researchers analyzed placental specimens from 320 subjects, providing an initial view of the human placental microbiome, which had not previously been studied in such detail. Credit: V. Altounian/Science Translational Medicine. Surprising new research shows a small but diverse community of bacteria lives in the placentas of healthy pregnant women, overturning the belief that fetuses grow in a pretty sterile environment. These are mostly varieties of ""good germs"" that live in everybody. But Wednesday's study also hints that the make-up of this microbial colony plays a role in premature birth. It allows us to think about the biology of pregnancy in different ways than we have before, that pregnancy and early life aren't supposed to be these totally sterile events,"" said lead researcher Dr. Kjersti Aagaard of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. We share our bodies with trillions of microbesâ€”on the skin, in the gut, in the mouth. These communities are called our microbiome, and many bacteria play critical roles in keeping us healthy, especially those in the intestinal tract. A few years ago, the government's Human Microbiome Project mapped what makes up these colonies and calculated that healthy adults cohabitate with more than 10,000 species. Healthy newborns pick up some from their mother during birth, different bugs depending on whether they were delivered vaginally or by C-section. What about before birth? There have been some signs that the process could begin in-utero. This animation describes the placental microbiome. Credit: Science/AAAS But, we have traditionally believed in medicine that the uterus is a sterile part of the human body,"" said Dr. Lita Proctor of the National Institutes of Health, who oversaw the microbiome project. With the new research, ""we realize that microbes may play a role even in fetus development,"" added Proctor, who wasn't involved in the work. ""The results of this study now open up a whole new line of research on maternal and pediatric health. Aagard's team earlier had studied the microbiome of the vagina, and learned that its composition changes when a woman becomes pregnant. The puzzle: The most common vaginal microbes weren't the same as the earliest gut bacteria that scientists were finding in newborns. What else, Aagaard wondered, could be ""seeding"" the infants' intestinal tract? With colleagues from Baylor and Texas Children's Hospital, Aagaard analyzed 320 donated placentas, using technology that teases out bacterial DNA to evaluate the type and abundance of different microbes. The placenta isn't teeming with microbesâ€”it harbors a low level, Aagaard stressed. Among them are kinds of E. coli that live in the intestines of most healthy people.

(AP Photo/Agapito Sanchez, Baylor College of Medicine) But to Aagaard's surprise, the placental microbiome most resembled bacteria frequently found in the mouth, she reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The theory: Oral microbes slip into the mother's bloodstream and make their way to the placenta. Why does the body allow them to stay? Aagaard said there appears to be a role for different microbes. Some metabolize nutrients. Some are toxic to yeast and parasites. Some act a bit like natural versions of medications used to stop preterm contractions, she said. In fact, among the 89 placentas that were collected after preterm births, levels of some of the apparently helpful bacteria were markedly lower, she said. Aagaard is beginning a larger study to explore the link, planning to analyze the oral and placental microbiomes of more than 500 pregnant women at risk of preterm birth.

# article=["Google has snatched Titan Aerospace right from under Facebook's nose and purchased the drone maker for an undisclosed amount. An unnamed source close to the matter informed the Wall Street Journal about how Google told Titan Aerospace it would match any offer Facebook made. The social media giant ended up purchasing Ascenta, a company in the U.K. also working on unmanned flying vehicles, for $20 million. Drones are an intriguing prospect for the future of the Internet. Google has already started working on Project Loon, which aims to provide the world with Internet service by placing weather balloons all over the Earth's atmosphere. Titan's drones, on the other hand, are capable of staying in the air for years powered only by the sun. Facebook has a similar project, Internet.org, and is apparently trying to connect the world by flying solar-powered drones in the atmosphere. Amazon is another Internet-based company looking to utilize unmanned aircraft. CEO Jeff Bezos said the company is four or five years away from delivering certain items to its customers via unmanned helicopter drones. Titan Aerospace and Google share a profound optimism about the potential for technology to improve the world, Google said Monday in a statement obtained by USA Today. It's still early days, but atmospheric satellites could help bring Internet access to millions of people, and help solve other problems, including disaster relief and environmental damage like deforestation. Titan's drones can be used to monitor crops, aid in natural disaster relief efforts and data delivery. Google also said they will use the drones to develop algorithms to predict wind patterns, aiding flight plans. They're definitely looking for the next big innovation, Jeff Vining, an analyst at the Gartner research firm, told the San Jose Mercury News. Civilian uses for drones are going to explode far beyond the public safety and military uses we know of today."]
