Microblogging platform and Twitter homegrown rival in India, Koo has launched voluntary self-verification, where users can add their Aadhaar details to authenticate their accounts on the platform, a requirement under India\u2019s intermediary liability rules.\n\nThe company\u2019s move comes amid debates around verifying the identity of users on social media platforms and if that could potentially curb misinformation and ensure accountability of third-party content on such platforms.\n\nMust read | Koo wants to be the largest opinion platform of the world without an opinion of our own: Founder\n\nHow will Koo\u2019s self-verification work?\n\nSelf-verification is currently only voluntary; users are not required to mandatorily go through it as the company said it has launched the feature on a \u201cbest efforts\u201d basis.\n\n\u201cThe feature is available only to Indian nationals who have an Indian phone number linked to their Aadhaar number/government ID,\u201d Koo said. The company said it will not store any Aadhaar data related to the process of self-verification, and will only record if an Aadhaar number submitted for verification is validated or rejected by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Aadhaar agency.\n\nIt also said it will not display the name or Aadhaar number of a user unless the user chooses to do so. It did not respond to a query seeking clarification on who the \u201cgovernment-approved third-parties\u201d are.\n\nAt the moment, Koo\u2019s app seems to only be accepting users\u2019 Aadhaar numbers as valid government IDs.

The company said the validation of Aadhaar details submitted by a user would be carried out by \u201cgovernment-authorised third-parties\u201d. Only a visible tick will be shown next to a user\u2019s name who has successfully completed self-verification.\n\nKoo is adding a self-verification option.
